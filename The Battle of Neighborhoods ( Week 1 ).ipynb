Located on the shore of the Gulf of Finland. Together with the cities of Espoo, Vantaa, and Kauniainen, and surrounding commuter towns, Helsinki forms the Greater Helsinki metropolitan area, which has a population of nearly 1.5 million. The region\u2019s land area accounts for 1.2% of the area of the entire country, but it accommodates 27% of the Finnish population. \n\nHelsinki metropolitan area is the dominant region in the Finnish property market. The area is well recognised among foreign investors, and many large global players only invest in the capital region. Positive supply developments have, in turn, bolstered housing investment while at the same time mitigating price growth significantly. \n\nIn this project, we are aiming to analyse the relationship between the housing price & maturity index of various postal districts in Helsinki. \n"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "### 1.2 description of the data and how it will be used to solve the problem"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "To solve the above problem, we first need to define maturity index. As residents enjoy various amenities that have been developed over the years, which include transport networks, shopping malls, schools, and parks. We can use the diversity and abundance of the district to indicate the maturity index.\n\nFoursquare defines a three-level hierarchical structure of categories for venues. With nine top level categories: Arts & Entertainment, College & University, Food, Professional & Other Places, Nightlife Spot, Outdoors & Recreation, Shop & Service, Travel & Transport and Residence. \n\nHere is the thought: we can use **Foursquare** to get the information of different categories or venue one district has, to stand for its diversity and abundance of the district, in another word, the maturity index. \n\nThen using **Machine Learning** method to analyse the relationship between housing price & maturity index of various postal districts in Helsinki.\n"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "## 2.
